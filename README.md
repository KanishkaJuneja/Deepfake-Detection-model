# Deepfake Detection using Deep Learning Models

This repository contains code for detecting deepfake videos using various deep learning architectures implemented in TensorFlow and Keras. Deepfake videos are a form of synthetic media where a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else's likeness using artificial neural networks.

## Overview

The project aims to develop robust deep learning models capable of accurately detecting deepfake videos. It utilizes a dataset consisting of both authentic and deepfake videos for training and evaluation. The trained models are evaluated based on various performance metrics to assess their effectiveness in distinguishing between authentic and manipulated videos.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation contains a collection of both authentic and deepfake videos. Each video is labeled as either authentic or manipulated to facilitate supervised learning. The dataset is split into training and test sets to train and evaluate the deep learning models effectively.

## Model Architectures

The repository includes implementations of several deep learning architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), VGG16, Xception, and combinations of CNNs with other architectures. Each model is designed to analyze frame-level features extracted from videos to identify potential signs of manipulation indicative of deepfake videos.

## Training

The models are trained using the Adam optimizer with binary cross-entropy loss. Training is conducted on the training dataset for a specified number of epochs with batch processing to optimize model parameters effectively. Additionally, early stopping and model checkpoints are employed to prevent overfitting and ensure the best-performing models are retained.

## Evaluation

After training, the performance of the trained models is evaluated using various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC score. These metrics provide insights into the models' ability to correctly classify videos as authentic or deepfake.

## Results

The trained models demonstrate promising results in detecting deepfake videos, achieving high accuracy and robustness against manipulation techniques. Sample predictions and evaluation metrics are provided to showcase the models' performance on both the training and test datasets.

## Usage
